These TCP relay scripts can be used to expose any TCP/IP service running behind a NAT. This includes services that use HTTP, SSH, and so on.Â It is composed of two Node.js scripts - <code>relayc.js</code> and <code>relays.js</code>. The latest source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/tewarid/node-tcp-relay">GitHub</a>. Use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-tcp-relay">npm</a> to install.

The relays.js script is meant to be executed on the server visible on the internet as follows
```bash
tcprelays --relayPort port --servicePort port
```

relayPort is the port where the relay server will listen for incoming connections from the relay client. servicePort is the port where external clients can connect to the service exposed through the relay.

The relayc.js script is meant to be executed on a machine behind a NAT as follows
```bash
tcprelayc --host host --port port --relayHost host --relayPort port [--numConn count]
```

host is any server visible to the machine behind the NAT, it can also be localhost. port is the port of the service you want to expose through the relay. relayServer is the host or IP address of the server visible on the internet, and already executing the relays.js script. relayPort is the port where this script will connect with the relay server. numConn is the number of unused sockets relay client maintains with the relay server. As soon as it detects data activity on a socket, relay client establishes another connection.

If you're using HTTP/S, use a reverse proxy such as http-proxy, between the relay client and the local service e.g.
```javascript
var httpProxy = require('http-proxy');
httpProxy.createProxyServer({target:'http://host:port'}).listen(port);
```
